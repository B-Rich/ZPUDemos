The VGA demo demonstrates making use of a simple VGA framebuffer with the
ZPU processor.

The VGA timing generator is by Peter Wendrich of Syntiac, the SDRAM
controller is adapted from Tobias Gubener's work.

Currently only one hardware register is implemented, the framebuffer base
address.  This framebuffer is a fixed 640x480 screen with 16-bit (5-6-5)
depth.  The demo program simply writes an incrementing value into the
framebuffer.
