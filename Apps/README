Projects residing in the Apps subdirectory are larger programs that won't fit
into block RAM and thus have to be bootstrapped either over RS232 serial or
from SD card.

Unlike the toplevel projects which are optimised to be lightweight and
freestanding, these apps make use of the C standard library, and demonstrate
how to override certain aspects of that library to suit the hardware platform
in use.

These apps are intended to be run on the "SystemOnChip" hardware project
(which has yet to be written!  In the meantime they'll run on either the
SDBootsrap or RS232Bootstrap projects.)
