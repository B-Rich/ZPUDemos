HelloC++

The HelloC++ app demonstrates basic usage of C++ classes, testing
inheritance, subclassing and exceptions.

The makefile specifies the full startup code, crt0.s since we need the
emulation table for unimplemented instructions.  We also supply the syscalls
and malloc code from Common_Firmware.  Please note: while it's possible to
use C++ language features in your own code, the stdc++ library is not tested
and it's highly likely that large chunks of it won't work with ZPUFlex without
some debugging and at the very least, adjustment of linkscripts.
