JPEGTest

JPEGTest demonstrates running full-featured software on the ZPUDemos SOC
platform, including loading files from disk, and making use of libJPEG.
The project can be bootstrapped either over RS232 or by SD card, but either
way the SD card needs to contain the bird.jpeg file.

If bootstrapping over RS232, simply upload the JPEGTest.sre file.
If bootstrapping by SD card, the card needs to contain JPEGTest.bin
and manifest.mst
