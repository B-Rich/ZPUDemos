Hello World

The Hello World app demonstrates writing to the UART, using the small_printf
function, and keeping the code size small by omitting the standard C library.

The makefile specifies the full startup code, crt0.s since we need the
emulation table for unimplemented instructions.  We also specify premain.s
since we're not including the standard C library.

We leave out the stock startup code and C library by specifying -nostartfile
-nostdlib at the linker stage, and pull in the requisite math functions by
adding -lgcc to the LIBS variable.  The latter is tested in main.c by
performing a division as part of the printf call.  (We ensure that the
division isn't optimised out by making the source of the division a volatile
variable.)

The makefile creates .elf, .bin and .sre files.
The .bin file, when placed on an SD card alongside the manifest.mst file,
can be booted and run by the SDBootstrap demo project, while the .sre file
can be sent over RS232 Serial to the RS232Bootstrap demo project.
