The Hello World app demonstrates writing to the UART, using the small_printf
function, making limited use the the standard C library and maximising
performance.

The makefile specifies the full startup code, crt0.s since we need the
emulation table for unimplemented instructions.  We also specify premain.s
since we're not making use of the standard C library for anything beyond
strcmp and memcpy, so don't need to worry about initialising malloc heaps
or file descriptors.

We leave out the stock startup code specifying -nostartfile at the linker
stage.  Everything is compiled with high optimisation (-O6) and we tell GCC
to avoid instructions we don't implement in hardware with
	-mno-callpcrel -mno-pushspadd -mno-poppcrel -mno-poppcrel -mno-div
	-mno-mod -mno-neg
thus saving the overhead of an emulation call.

The makefile creates .elf, .bin and .sre files.
The .bin file, when placed on an SD card alongside the manifest.mst file,
can be booted and run by the SDBootstrap demo project, while the .sre file
can be sent over RS232 Serial to the RS232Bootstrap demo project.
