This Hello World project demonstrates reducing the size of the ZPUFlex
process to the absolute minimum, by reducing the address bus width.

In the RTL we provide a simple UART (transmitter portion only), and
instantiate the ZPUFlex core with all the optional features disabled.
The entire project, including UART, is just 546 logic elements on the DE1.

Quartus projects are provided for the DE1 board to date -
others may follow.
